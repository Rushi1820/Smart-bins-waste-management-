In a hackathon we got a case where lot of man power and fuel wastage is been seen in day to day collection of wastage from the bins.As,somedays the bins remain empty and also the wastage as mixture of both wet and dry.

We are trying to develop a waste management system which can manage waste efficiently using smart bins. These smart bins can differentiate dry waste and wet waste using humidity sensing mechanism ,a combination of tactile sensing and object detection can be used to determine wastage level filled inside the bin. The sensors and the microcontroller will be powered by a battery of 15 days backup which can be charged by solar power. When the bin is filled 75% an alert will be send to the control station through FM transmission.
When multiple alerts are received by control station from same locality a garbage collecting vehicle will be dispatched, by this the collection of waste can be done more efficiently because garbage collectors will not know if the bins are filled or empty, if the bins are empty there is no use of garbage collector. By this system they will get to know that which bins are filled and which are empty.
At first we will place one bin for every 500-700 meters depending on the rate at which the bins are filled we can increase or decrease the size of the bin.
