# Smart-bins-waste-management-
I and my friend had come up with the solution for  waste management system.
Problem case is as follows:
                 In a hackathon we got a case where lot of man power and fuel wastage is been seen in day to day collection of wastage from the bins.As,somedays the bins remain empty and also the wastage as mixture of both wet and dry.
